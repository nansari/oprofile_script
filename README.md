   OProfile is capable of monitoring native hardware events occurring in all parts of a running system,
   from the kernel (including modules and interrupt handlers) to shared libraries to binaries. OProfile
   can collect event information for the whole system in the background with very little overhead. These
   features make it ideal for monitoring entire systems to determine bottle necks in real-world systems.
